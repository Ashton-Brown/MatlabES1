# MatlabES1
 A 1D particle-in-cell (pic) solver for plasma simulation, and related project scripts based on Birdsall and Langdon's ES1 text, in MATLAB (R2019a).  The pic solver (all contained in the subfolder called 'ES1PicSolver') is designed for periodic boundaries and has options to use the nearest-grid-point or the cloud-in-cell method for determining the charge density, rho, on the grid and the field, E, at the particles.  Poisson's equation for determining the voltage, phi, on the grid is solved using MATLAB's linear algebra solver '\'.  An option to solve for phi using the fft method is built in, but not yet fully functional.  The project scripts include verifying the plasma frequency for a few oscillating electrons in a uniform neutralizing background, two stream instabilities (e-e and e-p), and the beam-plasma instability.  Animating the simulation (rho, E, phi, and force all versus position) as the solver is running can be turned on and off.
